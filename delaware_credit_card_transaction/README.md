  - Retrieve all records from Delaware_Checkbook.
   ```sql
   SELECT
   *
   FROM
   [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
   

   ```

  - 📊 Count the total number of rows.
   ```sql
   SELECT
   COUNT(*) AS [TOTAL ROW]
   FROM
   [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```

- 📊 **Table Description**<br>

  - Execute sp_help to display the table structure and metadata.

  - Change column's data type from SMALLINT to INT.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  ALTER COLUMN
  [FISCAL_YEAR] int;


  ALTER TABLE
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  ALTER COLUMN
  [FISCAL_PERIOD] int;
  
  ```


-  📊 **Check for Null Values**

  - Perform distinct counts of records for several key columns (e.g., FISCAL_YEAR, FISCAL_PERIOD, DEPT_NAME) to identify any null entries.No Null values are found


- 📊 **Remediate Data Issues**

  - Update MERCHANDISE_AMT to eliminate negative signs and round the values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [MERCHANDISE_AMT],
  COUNT(*) AS [COUNT ROWS],
  round(replace([MERCHANDISE_AMT], '-', ''), 2)
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook]
  GROUP BY
  [MERCHANDISE_AMT]
  ORDER BY
  [MERCHANDISE_AMT],
  [COUNT ROWS] ASC 
  ```


- 📊 **Create New Columns**

  - Add a new column for FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH representing the month corresponding to the fiscal period.
  - Populate this column based on the fiscal period values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [FISCAL_PERIOD],
  CASE
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 7 THEN 'January'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 8 THEN 'February'

    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 2 THEN 'August'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 3 THEN 'September'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 4 THEN 'October'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD] = 5 THEN 'November'
  ELSE 'December'
  END AS [FISCAL_PERIOD]
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```



- 📊 **Create a Season Column**

  - Add another column for FISCAL_PERIOD_SEASON and populate it with the corresponding season based on month values.
  ```sql
  SELECT
  DISTINCT [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH],
  CASE
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'January' THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'February' THEN 'Winter'
    WHEN [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH] = 'March' THEN 'Spring'

  ELSE [FISCAL_PERIOD_MONTH]
  END AS season
  FROM
  [dbo].[Delaware_Checkbook];
  ```
