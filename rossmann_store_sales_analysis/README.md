# Best Model Selection and Analysis

## Best Overall Model
**CatBoost Regressor** demonstrates the most accurate predictions with:
- **Lowest RMSE:** 624.41
- **High R¬≤ score:** 0.9338
- **MAPE:** 7.5%

This combination indicates excellent predictive accuracy and strong variance explanation, making CatBoost the most reliable model for precise sales forecasting.

## Close Contenders
- **XGBoost Regressor:**  
  RMSE of 642.07 and R¬≤ of 0.93 , closely following CatBoost, showing competitive performance in capturing data relationships.
- **PyCaret (with multiple regressors):**  
  RMSE of 1,073,553.77, though higher than boosting models, still provides valuable insights but with less precision, despite a good R¬≤ score.

## Forecasting Models
- **Prophet with Additional Regressors (promos, holidays, etc.):**  
  Outperforms other models with an impressive RMSE of **525,387.66**, indicating improved modeling of seasonal patterns and events.
- **Prophet with Holiday Effects Only:**  
  Also performs well but doesn't match the accuracy of the regressors-enhanced version.

## Deep Learning
- **LSTM Model:**  
  Achieves an RMSE of **916.26**, indicating potential but still higher than the top boosting models. It suggests that further tuning or utilizing more data could improve its performance.

---

## Explanation & Analysis

### RMSE as a Metric
- **Prioritized** because it penalizes large errors heavily, which is critical in sales forecasting to avoid costly mispredictions.

### Best Tools & Techniques
- **Tree-based ensemble models (CatBoost, XGBoost):**  
  Excel at handling structured, tabular data and capturing complex relationships.
- **Prophet:**  
  Demonstrates excellent seasonality and event modeling, especially when augmented with regressors.
- **LSTM (Deep Learning):**  
  Offers promising results but may require further tuning, more data, or architectural adjustments for better accuracy.

---

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **CatBoost** is the most reliable and accurate predictor owing to its lowest RMSE and high R¬≤ score.
- It is recommended for deployment to ensure precise and stable sales forecasts.

This selection ensures optimal performance for business intelligence, planning, and strategic decision-making.
