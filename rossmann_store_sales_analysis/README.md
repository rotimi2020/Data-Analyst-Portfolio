## Problem Definition
Rossmann, a major drugstore chain, aims to optimize its inventory and 
staffing by accurately forecasting daily sales at individual stores. 
Challenges include handling large datasets, missing data, outliers, 
and complex patterns due to promotions, holidays, and store-specific factors.

you can download the dataset which features the following key data fields:

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each store-date pair (only in test set).
- **Store**: Store identification number.
- **Sales**: The target variable representing total sales for each day.
- **Customers**: The number of customers visiting the store on that day.
- **Open**: Indicator whether the store was open (1) or closed (0).
- **Promo**: Whether the store was participating in a promotion on that day.
- **StateHoliday**: Indicator of public holidays affecting sales.
- **SchoolHoliday**: Whether schools were on holiday, influencing customer traffic.
- **StoreType**: Classification of store type.
- **Assortment**: Level of product assortment available.
- **CompetitionDistance**: Distance to the nearest competing store.
- **Promo2**: Ongoing promotional campaigns.
- **Date**: The specific date of observation.


## Files Included
- `train.csv`: Historical sales data (~1 million rows, approximately 36.2 MB)
- `test.csv`: Recent or upcoming sales data (~41k rows)
- `store.csv`: Store information (~1,115 rows)
- `sample_submission.csv`: Format template for submissions


## File Sizes
| File                 | Approximate Size  | Description                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `train.csv`        | 36.2 MB           | Contains daily store sales and transaction details  |
| `test.csv`         | 2 MB              | Data for prediction (future sales)                   |
| `store.csv`        | < 1 MB            | Static store-specific attributes                     |
| `sample_submission.csv` | < 1 KB         | Example submission format                            |



## Important Notes
- Due to size constraints (GitHub maximum upload size is 25MB), the `train.csv` file cannot be directly uploaded here since it exceeds this limit.
- The dataset has been imported into SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- You can download the datasets directly from Kaggle using their platform or API.



## Usage
- Use this dataset for predictive modeling, data analysis, or feature engineering.
- Refer to `store.csv` for static store info to enhance your models.
- Utilize this data to identify sales patterns, forecast future sales, or optimize promotional strategies<br>

## Data Processing & Cleaning
Utilized SQL and Python to clean and transform data:
- Removed duplicates (172,132 entries)
- Handled missing values and null entries
- Converted data types (e.g., date to datetime, categorical to integers)
- Engineered new features and transformed existing ones:
  - StoreType and Assortment encoding
  - Normalized and discretized PromoInterval
- Outlier detection and removal (30,778 outliers)

## üß™ Feature Engineering

- **Date Features**: Year, Month, Day, IsWeekend, Season
- **Lag Features**: `Sales_Lag_7`, `Sales_Lag_30`
- **Moving Averages**: `Sales_MA_7`
- **Categorical Encoding**: `StoreType`, `Assortment`
- **Holiday & Promotion Effects**: Capture the impact of holidays and promotions on sales, considering how these events influence customer behavior and sales patterns.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL & Visualization)
- **Daily sales trends:** Visualized sales over time
- **Annual and monthly trends:** Identified seasonal patterns
- **Weekly sales:** Analyzed weekly fluctuations
- **Customer behavior:** Summarized by year
- **Key findings:** 
  - Sales peak during holidays and special promotions
  - Store types and proximities significantly impact sales
  - Promotions and holidays are major sales drivers

## üßæ SQL Overview

This project uses SQL to clean, transform, and extract insights from the Rossmann Store Sales dataset.  
The SQL queries were used for data preprocessing, calculating key metrics, and preparing data for Power BI and forecasting models.

Key objectives:
- Cleaning and transforming raw data
- Creating features for analysis (e.g., holidays, promo effects)
- Generating KPIs (e.g., daily sales, average per store)
- Preparing time-series ready data
